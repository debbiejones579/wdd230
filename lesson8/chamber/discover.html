                    Hooper is a city in Weber County, Utah, United States, first called Muskrat Springs and later
                    Hooperville for Captain William Henry Hooper,[3] an early Utah delegate to Congress. The population
                    was 9,087 at the 2020 census, up from the 2010 figure of 6,932. Prior to the city's incorporation on
                    November 30, 2000, Hooper was an unincorporated census-designated place (CDP).

                Salt Air is a venue that was built in the early 1900s for people to gather on the great salt lake. At
                one time there was a fariss wheel and merry go round.. The intererier is gorgeous and has been kept
                prestine for iths era. The pillars surrounding the front door are a tease of what there is to stee
                inside the goergeous venue. Beware, this place has been on all the finding ghost shows. There is proof
                that there are others residing at Salt Air, these people have been dead for 100 years.

                    In the summer, Hooper has some of the best Rodeos around Utah. The rodeos have a small town feel,
                    but with big names that come to ride in the beautiful outdoor arena. The seating is amazing, all
                    seats are no more than 10 feet away from the horses and bulls. It is a unique experience for sure.

                    According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 11.7 square miles (30.3
                    km2), of which 11.5 square miles (29.9 km2) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.4 km2) (1.45%) is water.

                    Fremont Island in the Great Salt Lake is included in this city's boundary. On March 30, 2007, Glenn
                    Barrow became the first Hooper mayor to visit the island in the city's brief history.[5]

                    Hooper was settled in 1854, and become a township in 1997 (about 15 years after a failed vote to
                    incorporate). Over the next several years "it became evident that the township board could make
                    plans and suggestions, but had no official power," so a vote to incorporate passed on May 2, 2000,
                    with the city being officially incorporated on November 30, 2000.[4]

                    in hunting.
