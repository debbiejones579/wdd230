       <p>
        Hooper is situated on the delta of the Weber River, the center of the town being three mile east of the shores of the Great Salt Lake and approximately twelve miles from the mouths of Ogden and Weber Canyons.  The Weber River flows through the northern part of town shortly before it pours its water into the Great Salt Lake. Much of what is now the city has traditionally been devoted to agricultural land uses including the raising of animals and the cultivation of alfalfa, grain, corn, and onions. Hooper is known for their Tomatoes. The residents of Hooper express a strong desire to maintain the "rural feel" of the area. There are no stop lights, very few streetlights and even less sidewalks. On a warm summer night all you can hear are the sounds of crickets playing the melody of Hooper.
Hooper is a family friendly town with celebration of July 4th and Hooper Tomato Days on Labor Day. In the town square is the elementary school and post office. A block west is a Hooper Park and arena. The 100-year-old trees provide shade in the hot summer days. It‚Äôs a nice place to spend the afternoon with your family or to have family reunions. The park has a bowery with serving facilities, restrooms. Playground and a baseball diamond. On the northeast of the park is a full rodeo arena. The arena is home to Hooper Posse and 4H club. It also hosts rodeos throughout the summer. 
The west end is surrounded by Weber County Bird refuge which is the home of over 300 species of birds.  The bird enthusiast scatter on the dirt roads that wind through the bay. They are just waiting to find the one unique bird.
